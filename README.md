# 5e-sapper
Homebrew Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition Class, loosely based on the [Unearthed Arcana Artificer](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/1_UA_Artificer_20170109.pdf) from a while back.

Sappers are volatile explosives experts that rely on a seemingly endless supply of improvised alchemical explosives. They have a cursory understanding of magic, and have a handful of spells that can be cleverly used to great effect.

# Class Features
## Magical Analysis
Starting at 1st level, you can investigate magical item and effects to analyze and understand their secrets. You can spend 10 minutes investigating a magical item or effect via whatever probing you deem necessary. If you do, you learn information comparable to what Detect Magic and Identify might tell you. The GM may ask you to roll Arcana as a part of this process.

## Concoctions
At 1st level, you learn two Alchemical Concoction options of your choice. You learn an additional concoction of your choice at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th levels. To use any of these options, you must be within reach of a set of Alchemist's Supplies. If the concoction requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. You can always choose to make concoctions weaker than you might have otherwise, so a 17th level Alchemist can still choose to make a 1st level Phos-Popper.

Each concoction takes an action to create, and only becomes active after the end of your turn. They can be thrown, drank, handed to an ally who immediately freely drinks them, or otherwise used, with a bonus action. If you are knocked unconscious while holding an active formula, you drop it and it goes off as soon as it hits the ground. At the end of your turn, your active formulas go off.


#### Phos-Popper
You quickly crystalize some inflammable powders into a deadly projectile that hurts to even smell. You can throw this projectile at a space within 30 feet. It explodes on impact with anything, or at the end of your turn. Anyone within a 15 foot diameter circle centered on the projectile must make an immediate Dexterity Saving throw. Anyone who fails their save immediately takes magical fire damage. However, this formula also sticks to the target and continues to burn painfully, inflicting magical fire damage again at the start of your next turn. There is no additional save at that point, and the fire cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. Dispell effects treat the fire as a cantrip. The damage dealt is based on your total character level, and the table below.

Level | Damage 
----- | ------
1-3   | d8
4-7   | 2d8
8-11  | 2d8 + Int Bonus
12-15 | 3d8 + Int Bonus
16-20 | 4d8 + Int Bonus

#### Stim-Shine
You serve out a little bit of the stim-shine that you've been working on. It's a "healing potion" that kicks like a Tarrasque and has not been conclusively proven to cause liver or colon cancer when used in moderation. The drinker regains hit points, and then must immediately takes a move action that does not consume any of their actions this round. They must move their full move distance, but they can move back and forth, or in circles. Drinkers that have partaken of this substance will not benefit from drinking more until they have taken a short rest.

Level | Healing 
----- | ------
1-3   | d8
4-7   | 2d8
8-11  | 2d8 + Int Bonus
12-15 | 3d8 + Int Bonus
16-20 | 4d8 + Int Bonus

#### Smoke Sticks
You light off something smoky from your supplies, and toss it to a location within 30 feet. It bursts into a thick cloud of smoke, making it impossible to see through in a 30 foot high, 10 foot diameter veritical cylinder. It is also impossible to breath within the cylinder, though characters that notice the smoke starting have time to start holding their breath before the smoke fills the air. The smoke lasts for one minute, and can be any color that the alchemist prefers.
This simple formula becomes rote with time, and the Alchemist will eventually be able to create and deploy multiple smoke bombs at once, targeting each independently of the others.

Level | Simultaneous Smokes 
----- | ------
1-3   | 1 smoke
4-7   | 2 smoke
8-11  | 3 smoke
12-15 | 4 smoke
16-20 | 5 smoke

#### Fulminated Whoopass
Yeah, there's a technical term, but most don't use it. You make these out of just about anything in your supplies, and so long as you crush it up good, you can throw it up to 30 feet. It blows everything in a 15 foot diameter blast zone that fails a Constitution save back a good couple feet from wherever it hit. Creatures that hit walls or other solid obstructions before they complete their flight fall prone.

Level | Knockback
----- | ------
1-2   | 5 feet
3-4   | 10 feet
5-6   | 15 feet
7-8   | 20 feet
9-10  | 25 feet
11-12 | 30 feet
13-14 | 35 feet
15-16 | 40 feet
17-18 | 45 feet
19-20 | 50 feet

## Quick Learner
Sappers are highly adaptable. At each even numbered level, you gain proficiency in another type of tools, or a single weapon.

## Stabilize
Starting at second level, you can spend a bonus action to deactivate one held concoction, thereby preventing it from activating at the end of your turn. You can keep doing so turn after turn if you desire, but you cannot permanently stymie the reaction.

## Magical Pragmatist
Over time, Alchemists gain a sense of exactly how much magic is required to get the job done. Starting at fifth level, you can use this knowledge to attune to one additional magic item at a time.

## Expertise
Starting at fifth level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for all of your tool proficiencies.

# Known Bugs/Upcoming Features
- Concoctions should be readiable for the purposes of ambushes, and should be active at the end of your turn so that you can  accidentally drop them on yourself and your friends. However, it should not be possible to let your turn end, and then use a readied action to use a concoction that you've just begun making that turn.
- More concoctions should be added. A few undeveloped ideas are:
  - Alchemical Acid that reduces the target's AC and saves, or perhaps just gives us advantage on hits against them.
  - Glue Bomb
  - Grease slick (potentially flammable)
  - Demolitions explosives
  - Crystalline Instant Barricades
- Spells!
